        HTML  (Hyper-Text  Makeup  Laguage)  is  used  to  display  information  in  Web  pages.
    
        Essentially,  HTML  is  used  to  tell  the  browser  how  to  structure  and
    
        present  content  in  a  Web  page.

        A  language  closely  related  to  HTMMl  is  XHTML  (EXtensible  HTML),
    
        which  is  almost  identical  to  HTML  with  stricter  rules  to  conform
    
        to  XML  (EXtensible  Mark-up  Laanguage).

            Elements  like  headings,  paragraph,  lists  and  table,  are  called  <dfn>semantic  elements</dfn>,
        
            which  are  elements  that  convey  information  about  their  contents  to
        
            browsers,  screen  readers  and  search  engines.
